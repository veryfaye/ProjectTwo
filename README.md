# Space Invaders-UCSD coding Bootcamp Project 2
Second Project for Coding Bootcamp
## Description
  This was a collaborative project for a coding bootcamp. We utilized several technologies including Node, Express, Express-Handlebars, and passport. We used MySQL as our database along with sequelize ORM. We used JAWS DB for deployment to Heroku. 

  The game framework was provided by [Dave Kerr](https://github.com/dwmkerr/spaceinvaders). We made graphical changes to the start and end game screens. We also changed the ship and alien images.
